DatabaseOwner clam
# This option allows you to easily point freshclam to private mirrors.
# If PrivateMirror is set, freshclam does not attempt to use DNS
# to determine whether its databases are out-of-date, instead it will
# use the If-Modified-Since request or directly check the headers of the
# remote database files. For each database, freshclam first attempts
# to download the CLD file. If that fails, it tries to download the
# CVD file. This option overrides DatabaseMirror, DNSDatabaseInfo
# and ScriptedUpdates. It can be used multiple times to provide
# fall-back mirrors.
# Default: disabled
